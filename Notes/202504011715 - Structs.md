Structs allow you to create custom data types by combining multiple fields of differnet types inton a single unit. Think of them as blueprints for objects that hold related data, similar to structs in C 

1. Named-Field Struct
    
    - Define it with named fields.
        
    - Create instances using key-value syntax.
        
    - Access fields with dot notation (.).
        
    
    rust
    
    ```rust
    struct Point {
        x: i32,
        y: i32,
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let p = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
        println!("x: {}, y: {}", p.x, p.y);
    }
    ```
    
2. Tuple Struct
    
    - Define it like a named tuple.
        
    - Access fields by index (e.g., .0, .1).
        
    
    rust
    
    ```rust
    struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
    
    fn main() {
        let rgb = Color(255, 128, 0);
        println!("R: {}, G: {}, B: {}", rgb.0, rgb.1, rgb.2);
    }
    ```
    
3. Unit Struct
    
    - No fields, just a type.
        
    - Useful for implementing traits without data.
        
    
    rust
    
    ```rust
    struct Marker;
    
    fn main() {
        let m = Marker;
    }
    ```

Ownership and Structs

- Structs follow Rustâ€™s ownership rules. If a struct contains a field that owns heap data (e.g., String), moving the struct moves ownership of that data.
    
- Example:
    
    rust
    
    ```rust
    struct User {
        name: String,
        age: u32,
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let u1 = User {
            name: String::from("Alice"),
            age: 30,
        };
        let u2 = u1; // Ownership moves to u2; u1 is invalid
        // println!("{}", u1.name); // Error!
        println!("{}", u2.name);    // Works
    }
    ```

Updating Structs

- Use struct update syntax (..) to create a new instance based on an existing one:
    
    rust
    
    ```rust
    let u2 = User {
        age: 31,
        ..u1  // Copies remaining fields from u1
    };
    ```
    
- Note: This moves u1 unless its fields implement Copy (e.g., i32), so u1 becomes invalid.
