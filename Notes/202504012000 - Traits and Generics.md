Traits and generics in Rust are powerful tools for writing reusable , flexible and type-safe code . They enable abstraction over type while mantaining Rust's emphasis on performance and safety . Let's dive into each concept and how they work together 

### Generics

Generics allow you to write functions , structs or enums that can operate on different types without duplicating code . They're like templates in C++ or generics in Java, but with Rust's unique ownership and life time system 

- You define a generic type parameter using angle brackets <"T">
- The compiler generates specific version of the coede at compile time so there's no runtime overhead
